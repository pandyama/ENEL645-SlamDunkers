# ENEL645 - Group 6 Final Project - Garbage Classification

## Group Members
### Gregory Slowski, Brandon Quan, Zachary Frena, Michael Kissinger, Meet Pandya

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to use deep learning classification models on a dataset which consists of various pictures of garbage, with associated labels for their appropriate disposal location being the black, blue, and green bins, as well as take-to-recycle. The 5 classification models used are from the Keras Applications page, which include VGG-16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and InceptionV3.

## File Structure Description:
The 5 different folders contained within this repo correspond to the 5 Keras pre-built models the team used. Within each folder there are various sub-folders for different modeling runs such as with and without transfer learning, more epochs, and including dropout in the modeling. Within these subfolders the relevant python files are included, as well as their outputs, not including .h5 model files, as some of them are too large to be included on GitHub.
